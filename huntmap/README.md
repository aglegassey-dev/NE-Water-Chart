# Freeport Hunt Map

A standalone hunting map app for Freeport, Maine: legal hunting zones on Freeport Conservation Trust land,
onX-style terrain and food layers, waypoints, tracks and live GPS. It works offline.

It's a static installable web app (PWA): no build step, no server, no accounts. Open it on your phone and
**Add to Home Screen** (iPhone: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen; Android: Chrome → Install app).

## Features

- **Legal zones:** FCT preserves colored by hunting status (firearm & bow / bow only / no hunting). Live GPS
  status shows the distance to the boundary and warns when GPS accuracy is larger than that distance. Also
  includes about 100-yard firearm safety circles around E911 address points, a Sunday warning and calculated
  legal shooting hours.
- **Terrain:** 1 m LiDAR terrain base and hillshade (Maine GeoLibrary), slope-angle shading
  (10–15°, 15–25°, 25–35°, 35°+), USGS contours with labels, USGS streams.
- **Food / hardwoods:** Maine leaf-off aerial imagery (hardwoods look gray/brown, conifers dark green),
  NLCD 2021 hardwood forest (30 m), USFS oak forest groups (250 m).
- **Presets:** Terrain scout · Terrain on satellite · Food / hardwoods · Plain satellite.
- **Waypoints:** long-press or ＋ to add one (stand, blind, camera, scrape, rub, bedding, oaks, water, …)
  with notes and photos. Drag to move, and tap **Go** to navigate with live distance and bearing.
- **Tracks:** ● records your walk.
- **GPX/KML import and GPX export:** compatible with onX, Garmin and Gaia.
- **Offline maps:** download every selected layer for the area on screen. Zones, waypoints and GPS
  work with no signal.
- **Wind:** current conditions and hourly forecast with scent-direction arrows (Open-Meteo).

Waypoints, photos and tracks are stored on the device (IndexedDB). Export a GPX as a backup.

## Deploy

Any static host with HTTPS works (GPS requires HTTPS). On Netlify, create a new site from this repo
with **Base directory** `huntmap` and no build command. `netlify.toml` sets the headers.

Local test: `python3 -m http.server 8000` in this folder, then open http://localhost:8000.

## Code layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `app.css` | UI shell and styles |
| `js/main.js` | App wiring: map, zones, GPS, waypoints, tracks, sheets |
| `js/layers.js` | Base maps and terrain/forest overlays (URL functions shared with offline download) |
| `js/offline.js` | Offline area downloads into Cache Storage (`hunt-tiles`) |
| `js/geo.js`, `js/db.js`, `js/gpx.js`, `js/weather.js` | Geometry/sun math, IndexedDB, GPX/KML, wind |
| `sw.js` | Service worker: offline app shell + cache-first tiles. **Bump `VERSION` when shell files change.** |
| `data.js` | Generated zone data (do not edit by hand) |
| `vendor/leaflet` | Leaflet 1.9.4 |

## Updating zone data

Hunting status for each parcel is set in `STATUS` in `scripts/build-data.py` (transcribed from FCT's
"Hunting on Freeport Conservation Trust Preserves" map). Boundaries and address points are downloaded
from Maine GeoLibrary:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-data.py   # writes data.js
```

## Disclaimer

This is a guide, not legal advice. Boundaries and GPS can be off by tens of feet. Posted signs, FCT rules
(207-865-3985) and Maine IF&W regulations take priority.
